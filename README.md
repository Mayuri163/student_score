# student_score

**Project Overview**
This project is focused on predicting student scores based on the number of hours studied per day. By applying a simple linear regression model, we have determined the relationship between study time and exam performance. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, model building, and prediction based on the dataset provided.

**Dataset**
The dataset used consists of two variables:

Hours: The number of hours a student studies per day.
Scores: The percentage score the student achieved in their exam.

**Problem Statement**
The task is to predict a student's score based on the number of hours they study. Specifically, we want to know: "What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours per day?"

**Methodology**
1. Correlation Analysis
A correlation analysis was performed to understand the strength of the relationship between study hours and scores. It revealed a strong positive correlation between the two variables, indicating that as study hours increase, exam scores tend to increase as well.

2. Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model was built to predict exam scores based on the number of hours studied.

3. Model Results
The graph below represents the linear regression fit between study hours and exam scores, with the regression line demonstrating the trend.


4. Prediction
Using the trained model, we predicted the exam score for a student who studies 9.25 hours a day. The predicted score is 92.90%.

**Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates how linear regression can be applied to predict exam scores based on study hours. The model indicates that if a student studies for 9.25 hours a day, they are likely to score approximately 92.90% in their examination.
